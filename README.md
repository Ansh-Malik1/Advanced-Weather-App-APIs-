# Advanced-Weather-App-APIs-
This is a weather app with two different tabs. In one tab user can grant location access and the weather of user's current location will be displayed. The other tab will be of search weather
where user can search any location's weather.
This website uses two different APIs.
1. One is 'geolocation API' which fetches user's current location.
2. The other is weather API which will help to fetch weather data.

Also, if user grants location access, the location gets stored in session storage helping user to see its current location weather data until the session expires.
